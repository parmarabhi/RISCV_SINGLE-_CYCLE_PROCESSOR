# RISCV_SINGLE-_CYCLE_PROCESSOR
In this file i have included all the modules like Program Counter , Instruction Memory , Control Unit , Register File , ALU , Alu Control , Adder , Mux
and then instantiated in top level file with its test bench code of a RISCV Single Cycle Processor all the Instruction are carried out by one Single Cycle
to improve the efficiency and make it faster we can use pipelining but that is bit complex.
